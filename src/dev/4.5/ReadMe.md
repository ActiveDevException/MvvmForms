# MvvmForms Readme

Welcome to ActiveDevelop's MvvmForms Library Project. MvvmForm's purpose is to provide XAML ViewModel compatible support for Windows Forms Visual Basic and CSharp Projects and Solution with a fullblown WinForms Designer support. MvvmForms is Open Source (GPL), but Dual Licence. For more Information about MvvmForms licencing read the Licence section below.

## Why Mvvm for WinForms? Why not using XAML to begin with?

Good one.
