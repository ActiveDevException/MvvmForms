# MvvmForms Readme

Welcome to ActiveDevelop's MvvmForms Library Project. MvvmForm's purpose is to provide XAML ViewModel compatible support for Windows Forms Visual Basic and CSharp Projects and Solution with a fullblown WinForms Designer support. MvvmForms is Open Source (GPL), but Dual Licence. For more Information about MvvmForms licencing read the Licence section below.

## Why Mvvm for WinForms? Why not using WPF/XAML to begin with?

Good one. If you have the luxary of a clean start for your new project, and your development team is up to the task, you most probable do not need MvvmForms. But that is often not the case. In many cases, during the time between 1996 and 2010, millions of lines of code have been written for the Windows platform, and often in CSharp and Visual Basic .NET for Windows Forms, or even with Visual Basic 6. Many companies don't have the luxery of throwing them all away and start from scratch. And what for, anyway? Your solution works, is stable and tested. So, why not continue using it.
MvvmForms is for your, if your want to change your development paradigm for the Front End of your LOB Application to riskless migrate to a modern world, when there is Cloud First, Mobile First and the need to reuse big parts of your Windows Forms monolithic Application on tablets and phones.

Our company, located in Westphalia Germany, has specialized in migrating from a typical Windows Forms Code Behind paradigm to a modern architecture. And we help to do this in a feasble way. We know, your team does neither have the time nor the budget to start from scratch, and that is the reason we developed MvvmForms: To help our customers to enter the new world of software development without jeopardizing too much.

## How stable is MvvmForms? Have you done large LOB projects with it?

Yes, we have.

## So, MvvmForms is Open Source. Then, it's free, right?
